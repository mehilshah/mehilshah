### Hi there

[![Mehil's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mehilshah6&show_icons=true&theme=radical)]()

I currently work at Accenture India, as Software Engineer - Backend.

I am a B.Tech Computer Science graduate from Manipal University Jaipur and have previously worked as a Research Intern at ISRO, as a part of Communication Systems Group under Dr. Yogesh Prasad. I have experience working with different languages and frameworks and I am always looking to learn something new and work on new projects in my free time.

Some of my key skills include - Java, Spring Boot, React, Angular, Node.js, Express, C++ and Python.

And, last but not the least, I'm an avid chess player, love swimming and I usually spend my free time, trying to learn something new.
